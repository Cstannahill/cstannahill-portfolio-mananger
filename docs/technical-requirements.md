# Technical Requirements

This document outlines the specific technical requirements, constraints, and stipulations for the Portfolio Manager Dashboard application.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

- Define clear technical boundaries and requirements for the project
- Establish architectural constraints and integration requirements
- Document specific compatibility needs with the existing portfolio system
- Provide a reference for development decisions

## Core Requirements

1. **Extensibility** - The system must be designed with extensibility as a core principle, allowing for new features and capabilities to be added with minimal changes to the existing codebase.

2. **Compatibility** - Must be compatible with the existing portfolio website structure, requiring minimal changes to the current setup. The application should seamlessly work with existing MDX content.

3. **Self-Hosting** - The application must be deployable on self-hosted infrastructure with minimal costs. No dependency on premium SaaS offerings that would incur significant expenses.

4. **Lightweight Technology Stack** - Utilize lightweight technologies that can be deployed without fees, especially in the initial development phases.

5. **MongoDB First** - Prioritize MongoDB as the primary database technology for its document-oriented nature that aligns with portfolio content and to gain experience with it. Ensure it can be self-hosted without significant cost implications.

6. **Database Abstraction** - While prioritizing MongoDB, maintain a level of abstraction in the data access layer to allow for potential database changes if needed in the future.

7. **Future Open-Source Potential** - While initially designed for personal use, the architecture should consider potential future open-source release. Design decisions should account for multi-user scenarios without requiring significant refactoring.

## Integration Constraints

1. **MDX Compatibility** - Must maintain full compatibility with the existing MDX file structure, including frontmatter format and custom components.

2. **Non-Destructive Operations** - Any modifications to existing content must be non-destructive and preserve all existing metadata and formatting not explicitly changed by the user.

3. **Directory Structure Preservation** - Must respect and maintain the existing directory structure for project and blog content.

4. **Extensibility Without Modification** - New features should be able to be added without requiring modifications to the existing portfolio website structure.

## Technical Boundaries

1. **Infrastructure Requirements** - Must be deployable on lightweight, low-cost infrastructure such as basic VPS providers or containerized environments.

2. **MongoDB Optimization** - MongoDB deployment must be optimized for minimal resource consumption, potentially using MongoDB Atlas free tier during development and self-hosted MongoDB for production. Database design should focus on efficient document structures and appropriate indexing.

3. **Self-Contained Deployment** - The application should be deployable as a self-contained unit, with minimal external dependencies.

4. **API Usage Limits** - If integrating with external APIs, must respect free-tier limits and avoid dependencies on paid API tiers.

## Performance Requirements

1. **Resource Efficiency** - Must operate efficiently on minimal resources, suitable for low-cost hosting environments.

2. **Responsive UI** - The user interface must remain responsive even when performing operations on large MDX files or repositories.

3. **Optimization for Single User** - Initial performance optimizations should focus on single-user scenarios, with the flexibility to scale if needed for multi-user scenarios.

4. **Offline Capability** - Consider implementing offline functionality where appropriate to reduce server load and improve user experience.

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection** - Ensure portfolio content and analytics data are properly secured and protected from unauthorized access.

2. **Authentication** - Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms while keeping the system lightweight.

3. **Open Source Security** - If transitioning to open source later, ensure security practices are compatible with public repositories.

4. **Local-First Security** - Prioritize local-first security approaches that don't rely on expensive third-party security services.

## Scaling Considerations

1. **Personal to Multi-User Path** - Design with a clear path from single-user to multi-user support without requiring a complete rewrite.

2. **Open Source Readiness** - Document code and architecture decisions with potential open source contributors in mind.

3. **Modular Architecture** - Use a modular architecture that allows components to be upgraded or replaced individually as requirements evolve.

4. **Configuration Flexibility** - Provide configuration options that work for both personal use and potential shared/multi-tenant scenarios.

## Technology Selection Criteria

1. **Development Speed** - Prioritize technologies that enable rapid development and iteration.

2. **Community Support** - Prefer technologies with active communities and documentation.

3. **Deployment Simplicity** - Choose technologies that can be easily deployed on self-hosted infrastructure.

4. **Cost Efficiency** - Avoid technologies that require significant infrastructure or licensing costs.

5. **Future-Proofing** - Select technologies with a stable future outlook to minimize technical debt.

## Specific Technology Considerations

### Frontend

- **Next.js** - Aligns with existing portfolio implementation, provides flexibility for SSR/SSG/CSR as needed
- **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui** - Maintains design consistency with existing portfolio
- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience

### State Management

- **React Context API** - For simpler state requirements to keep bundle size small
- **Redux Toolkit** (optional) - Only if complex state management needs arise

### Database Options

- **MongoDB** - Primary database choice for document-based storage of portfolio content and analytics. Preferred for gaining experience with MongoDB and leveraging its document model which aligns well with the project structure.
- **Redis** - For caching layer and performance optimization where needed
- **SQLite** - Backup option only if MongoDB proves impractical for self-hosting requirements
- **LowDB/JSON Files** - For development or as fallback for minimal deployments

### Authentication

- **NextAuth.js** - Provides flexible authentication with minimal setup
- **Simple Password Protection** - For most basic security needs

### Deployment

- **Docker** - For containerized deployment options
- **Direct Node.js** - For simple VPS deployments
- **Serverless** - Only if compatible with self-hosted infrastructure

This document will be updated as requirements are clarified and refined throughout the development process.

## MongoDB Implementation Considerations

1. **Document Design** - Create document schemas that align with portfolio content structure while optimizing for query performance.

2. **Self-Hosting Options** - Research lightweight MongoDB self-hosting options including:

   - Docker containerization
   - Direct installation on VPS
   - MongoDB Atlas free tier (for development)

3. **Data Modeling** - Design MongoDB collections around the existing content structure:

   - Projects collection
   - Blog posts collection
   - Analytics data
   - User preferences

4. **Performance Optimization** - Implement proper indexing strategies for MongoDB to ensure good performance even on minimal hardware.

5. **Backup Strategy** - Develop a straightforward backup strategy for MongoDB data that can be automated.

6. **Learning Opportunity** - Document the MongoDB implementation process to maximize the learning experience.
