## Documentation Usage Guidelines

### Keeping Documentation Updated

As the project evolves, documentation should be kept in sync with the codebase:

1. Update data models when schema changes
2. Revise API documentation when endpoints change
3. Refine component structure as new components are added
4. Update deployment strategy as infrastructure evolves

### Documentation Maintenance Process

1. Review documentation before starting new features
2. Update affected documentation as part of the feature development process
3. Have documentation changes reviewed alongside code changes
4. Conduct periodic documentation audits to ensure accuracy
